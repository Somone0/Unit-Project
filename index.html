    <p>Candy why because I wanted to say it</p>
    <p> Now that I am done with all the requirements, and that I don't know what to do for this assignment despite literally having over a god damn month, I have decided to just talk about this class. Personally I feel like I did have fun with the website building part of this class, but that was only when I was learning and using new code, when I had to come up with an idea of how to use it, my brain just shuts down and can't think of anything, but none the less using the code and making something, or challenging yourself to make something is where I found fun in coding like this, I am guessing that in AP we do all of the assignments in runestone. I am intereseted in taking the AP class, but at the same time I have come to terms that personally I would like computer science/coding as a hobby, but not as a full time job, because as you've seen here, it doesn't seem like my kind of thing. I don't know what to say now, okay how about this did you know that the code for this &lt; &gt; to make this you have to use the special symbol from pressing shift 7 then lt; all combined to do that, for the closing tag you just change l for g. Well I don't know what to talk about anymore, At this point this is just filler I am writing, just writing whatever pops in my brain. As the school year passes by though my stress rises at the thought that I am going to have to grow up, where did that come from I don't know, I am done now I am seriously going to stop writing, goodbye hope you have a good day, actually not ending it yet, just kidding.</p>
